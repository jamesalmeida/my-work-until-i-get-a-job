		<h1>I'm James Almeida and I want to be a developer.</h1>
		<p>I'm going to make a webite once a day until I can find a job. I know some HTML and CSS and I am currently learning Ruby and Javascript. I figure this would be a good way to solidify everything I've learned and the new things I'm learning everday. </p>
		<p>You can follow me here and on my <a href="..">blog</a>. I'm also on <a href="..">github</a> and <a href="..">twitter</a>.</p>
